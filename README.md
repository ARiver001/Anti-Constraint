# Anti-Constraint
Double tap b on the left controller to remove all constraints on all players, including yourself.

# Note
I was too lazy to make controls configurable or to fix some issues, as long as it works for me then it works. I hope it works for you.
If anyone wants to improve on it, please do so people don't have to use my shitty but working mod. Add more settings to it!

I uses some code from Lakatrazz's ragdoll mod for input
